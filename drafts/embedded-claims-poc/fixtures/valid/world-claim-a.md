# Fixture: world claim A (predicate /^## Теза [0-9]+:/)

Paired with world-claim-b.md. Same file, same byte digest (dependency_id), but a
DIFFERENT predicate. Their claim_id and result_value_id must differ; only the
dependency_id is shared. This is the P0-2 fix: the input digest is not the claim
address.

⟦count: /^## Теза [0-9]+:/ in README.md = 7⟧

Expected: execution=REPLAYED.
